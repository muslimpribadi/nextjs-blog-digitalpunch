I kinda believe this, but haven't find the right words, then this talks put things in the right context, I quote the podcast from Go Figure channel titled 10x engineer...

> On motivation to do more, the rush to get things done because we doing something good.

> The combination of business goals with this kick, this rush, can lead to burn out, because ultimately creating software and creating product is a creation proses 
> and its asymmetric, the value you create is not proportional to the time you put in,
> its proportional to your state of mind in that time you put in
> so if you've been working 80H/W for 3W your creative impact just crash."
