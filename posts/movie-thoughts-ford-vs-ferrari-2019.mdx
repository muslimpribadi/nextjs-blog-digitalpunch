My thoughts on the movie:

Bout under-appreciate genius engineer+driver Ken Miles because he is brutally honest & not suited for long chain of command bureaucratic Ford style.

Bout how Ford bosses doesn't even have a god damn clue on winning Le Mans race, only by emotional impulse, without professional measure, sure they win, but they miss the opportunity to win and build a better culture for their business at that time, humane one.

Bout the boss doesn't know the cost what he is asking but when they informed bout it they discount it badly.

Bout how executive order trample genuine victory -should-be collective victory-

Great movie though.
